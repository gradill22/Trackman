Trackman data visualization Python script for pitchers.
This is designed to handle as many Trackman .csv files as you require. It can do 1, or it can do 100 (if you're patient enough).
It will save all the visualizations in whatever folder you would like. You will first be asked which Trackman files you want to visualize, then you'll be asked which folder you want to save these visualizations in.
After selecting those things, this script will give you visualizations for every player and every outing.
